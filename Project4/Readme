This project is to create and implement a binary search tree.
The algorithm for this tree was taken from http://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com/binary-search-tree-complete-implementation/ by SJ

The Node class fills the node with null data and places nulls for the right hand side (rhs) and left hand side (lhs). 

The BinarySearchTree class has a default constructor which makes a null root node. 
The BinarySearchTree class has methods for find, delete, getSuccessor, insert, and display. 
The BinarySearchTree as modeled can only hold information of type int.
